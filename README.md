# Startup-board
Creating a startup board project in HTML involves developing a web application where users can manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate. Below is a basic outline and code snippets to help you get started. This project will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing startup board


HTML: Defines the structure of the page, including the input field for new tasks and three columns for tasks in different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).
CSS: Provides styling to make the board look clean and visually appealing.
JavaScript: Handles the functionality, allowing users to add tasks and move them between columns by clicking.
